Alright team, based on today's meeting, here's the gist of our situation:

Our client has a website for math tutoring and wishes for us to implement
a dashboard for faculty to view metrics on their site.

What metrics?

Basically everything you can imagine to be useful, the client didn't dive into specifics
too much, but mentioned things like user count, login times and durations, karma points (how useful a particular student's responses are), etc.  It seemed like she wanted us to intuitively guess what was useful, but a few other PM's pushed for clarity, so we may get
a concrete list in the future.

How will we do this?

The client's company (Algebra Nation) will provide us with an API and a faculty account soon, but right now, the company's tech team is busy (her words).  The company is a Silicon Valley based project, ergo, tech savvy--  so they don't really need our assistance per se.  To them, we're more of a lab experiment to see if we can generate ideas they haven't considered in project form (my opinion).

What's the status quo for now?

Next meeting, we'll be brainstorming ideas for the fundamental structure / implementation
of:

    - A Metric System for the Site
    - An Attractive GUI for System

As multiple groups in different sections will be working with the client, our priorities may change per request of the client. Though this is unlikely, we should try to keep ideas more abstract than concrete.
